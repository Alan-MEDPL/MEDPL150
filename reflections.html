<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p> This is my first reading reflection for "In Pluto's Cave.“In Pluto’s Cave” is a deep introspective overlook on all the intricate aspects of photography and its role in contemporary culture. Susan delves into the idea of photography bringing what normally could be temporary into an everlasting existence based on the power photography has to capture moments. This leads people to believe that photography is naturally more of a tool than an art since it has the capacity to remain neutral in its connotations. Although this is not necessarily true because just like art or writing where there are certain influences and interpretations, photography requires a filtered lens to extract the core of an image through lighting or composition. That is to say that a photograph is never as transparent as it seems because the curator of any photograph has specific intentions behind it.
The next idea is one of possession and how photography allows people to have an impression of being in possession over spaces. An example Susan gives of this is tourism and the voracity tourists have in proving their existence in an unfamiliar space. The idea of photos as proof of evidence is extremely compelling because it's not matched by other forms of interpretation like art or writing. It is able to capture views in the moment of what they were and their purest forms. She also mentions how photographs have become integral to the notion of a nuclear or “ideal” family. Photographs in the current era can show attentiveness and care for an object or people, a lack of family photos can suggest a lack of closeness. This way of taking photographs is not for the art or interpretation but rather the social qualities it holds. In recent years, the culture of taking photos to share with close ones is a highlight.

Susan also implies that photography also can be aggressive in nature because its nature is an intrusion of privacy. Photos have the sharpness of a double edged sword where its greatest strength is also its weakness; the power of capturing intimacy is invasive. Even if its just observation there are some voyeuristic qualities about taking photos and being this third person observer. There is a lot of nuance in this discussion because photography does not have the capability of removing autonomy of people and taking power away physically, but it has a different type of power over people which can create a sense of dread in the public sphere. It may contribute to feelings of agrophobia and resistance to photos.

Lastly, the conversation of how photographs are used to tell stories or bring light to events that would not be seen otherwise. It brings an existence to events that we are far detached from because we are not the ones being affected. Some of the most horrific images that are able to reach into our guts are war images that we have no correlation too. Most of these images are beyond our current time but the photos are able to save these stories to traverse time and reach us now. However, people may become desensitized to certain images if there were too many shown over a period of time.

Overall, Susan makes great points about all facets of photography by mentioning its pros and contentions. It is an entirely unique form of art that is capable of altering so much of the world.
