<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p> This is my first reading reflection for "In Pluto's Cave.“In Pluto’s Cave” is a deep introspective overlook on all the intricate aspects of photography and its role in contemporary culture. Susan delves into the idea of photography bringing what normally could be temporary into an everlasting existence based on the power photography has to capture moments. This leads people to believe that photography is naturally more of a tool than an art since it has the capacity to remain neutral in its connotations. Although this is not necessarily true because just like art or writing where there are certain influences and interpretations, photography requires a filtered lens to extract the core of an image through lighting or composition. That is to say that a photograph is never as transparent as it seems because the curator of any photograph has specific intentions behind it.The next idea is one of possession and how photography allows people to have an impression of being in possession over spaces. An example Susan gives of this is tourism and the voracity tourists have in proving their existence in an unfamiliar space. The idea of photos as proof of evidence is extremely compelling because it's not matched by other forms of interpretation like art or writing. It is able to capture views in the moment of what they were and their purest forms. She also mentions how photographs have become integral to the notion of a nuclear or “ideal” family. Photographs in the current era can show attentiveness and care for an object or people, a lack of family photos can suggest a lack of closeness. This way of taking photographs is not for the art or interpretation but rather the social qualities it holds. In recent years, the culture of taking photos to share with close ones is a highlight.Susan also implies that photography also can be aggressive in nature because its nature is an intrusion of privacy. Photos have the sharpness of a double edged sword where its greatest strength is also its weakness; the power of capturing intimacy is invasive. Even if its just observation there are some voyeuristic qualities about taking photos and being this third person observer. There is a lot of nuance in this discussion because photography does not have the capability of removing autonomy of people and taking power away physically, but it has a different type of power over people which can create a sense of dread in the public sphere. It may contribute to feelings of agrophobia and resistance to photos.Lastly, the conversation of how photographs are used to tell stories or bring light to events that would not be seen otherwise. It brings an existence to events that we are far detached from because we are not the ones being affected. Some of the most horrific images that are able to reach into our guts are war images that we have no correlation too. Most of these images are beyond our current time but the photos are able to save these stories to traverse time and reach us now. However, people may become desensitized to certain images if there were too many shown over a period of time. Overall, Susan makes great points about all facets of photography by mentioning its pros and contentions. It is an entirely unique form of art that is capable of altering so much of the world.</p>
<p>This is my reflection for Hw 4. Nesrine Malik, a Guardian columnist, in this article describes the disillusionment of people in regards to AI usage as there is an ever increasing concern for AI becoming a tool for fascism. The author introduces the readers to the difference between political imaging in real life Vs AI with different pictures of President Trump. In reality Trump looks no different than the rest of us with noticeable flaws, but in the AI generated image it shows him as a cartoonishly towering gold statue. These images depict an uncanny valley of dystopian political fantasy where unaware people are easily convinced of untrue realities. Malik notes the danger of this condition as it tends to affect elderly folks just knowledgeable enough to use technology but still not able to discern the difference from reality and AI. They may fall into a trap of political messaging or become even more disillusioned within their own political ideologies by believing these false images. In addition, Malik alludes to AI being a vessel to give narcissists an ego boost and further their fascist agenda. They also regard “AI slop” to be not only affecting Americans' perception of the world but foreign countries' perception of America. The example they give is how Chinese AI videos mocking American factory workers, which the spokesperson of the White House had to respond to. Overall, this usage of AI proved another argument of Malik, that AI is desensitizing us to real problems over a guise of humor. The AI “war” between American and Chinese netizens is proof of the disillusionment caused by AI. Both groups of people are reducing the other to stereotypes without basis, further funneling into a closeminded behavior and belief in people. Another example is the absolutely unnecessary use of AI by Elon Musk and his supporters to promote him in a reverent manner when he is no better than the rest of us. AI in this article has been shown to have political undertones and uses that involve manipulating people; whether it be be elderly or bandwagoning, into a certain mindset. This is exactly what corrupt leaders want so it would make sense that they seem to love AI regardless of the consequences. AI is a rapidly evolving technology that becomes hard to keep up with even as a person more adapted to technology. I believe especially after reading this article that it is crucial as a society to be educated on the usage of AI as well as its social, moral, artistic, and political implications. In addition, each day it’s becoming more and more involved in people’s daily lives whether it be to use AI for work purposes, school, or recreational use. Due to the unavoidable albeit unfortunate use of AI in many work spaces, especially tech I find it hard to imagine people would turn back from it now. Considering how effective AI can be at reducing labor costs, regardless of the hugely negative effects on people and the environment I believe the few at the top will ultimately push for the continued use of it. I also wonder how much the importance of journalism and verified media will become in the upcoming years as AI becomes even more prevalent. In order to fight the spreading of misinformation and propaganda I predict that boots on the ground journalism will see a rise that it hasn’t, because the only thing that can deny false narratives is proof of the real one. </p>
