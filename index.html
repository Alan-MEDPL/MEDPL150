<p> A developing creative design student with a background in multi-media arts; enjoys consuming different types of media from film, gaming, photography, journalism. Recently they are most interested in video essays discussig the entertainment industry as well as the current social climate. I grew up watching animations and cartoons so I'm more drawn to 2D forms of visual expression, since I think that animation is a powerful tool that humans can't replicate with live action so I'm curious about the future of animation and this form of storytelling. My asthetic revolves around messy but grounded art style and I enjoy diving into more fantastical elements instead of abstract or hyper realistic. I have experience in using Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Maya since I was in the Media Major in my high school, but I haven't used those programs since then. Overall I think media is a central part of contemporary art and life since it is interwoven in so many facets of everyday life, which is why it is so compelling to me and why I'm excited to dive deeper into it. </p>
