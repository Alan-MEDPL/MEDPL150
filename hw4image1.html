    <h1>Homework 4 Image 1</h1>

    <p>I feel like music is a universal hobby that everyone is able to enjoy whether you're from Greece, to Thailand, or Brazil. Across the globe we all have our own music that is intertwined with our culture that makes music an important part of our identity. Not only is important to many people's identity but it is also something many people enjoy and find relaxing. Me personally, I'm always listening to music when I'n traveling between classes or work so I tried to find an image on Creative Commons that represented the peaceful feeling I have when listening to music. I gathered many different images of instruments or music related items so I could incorporate many different cultures or musical elements into my collage. My main inspiration for this piece was Hannah Hoch, since I really enjoyed her ability to use asbtract shapes to create structures and realistic art. I wanted to attempt my own version of her style by cutting up different pieces of the images to create a scrapbook illusion. I originally kept the background image colored but as I was playing around I noticed that transfering it to greyscale made the instruments more cohesive with the body parts I was trying to cover. Not only this but it also worked well with my message of music bringing life and culture to a person. I used the lighter blending options for the bottom half of the girl because I wanted the images to have that faded affect and not be so bold. Instead I wanted more of the bold colored/ darker blends to be at the top where the head is so the focus is drawn towards the top instead of the bottom. In terms of scale and rhythm, I wanted to keep a movement of instruments going up so that your eyes are drawn to a certain point and have the girl taking roughly 2/3 of the image. :</p>
